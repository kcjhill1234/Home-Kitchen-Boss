### User Story
Everybody has had those moment where they just want to find something for dinner but don't know what. There's been too many times where we've been hungry but don't know what to make so we just end up getting takeout and leaving all of those ingredients in your fridge to get old and rot. So we dedided to do something about it. We decided to make an application that makes it quick and easy to find a good recipe for you taking allergies into to make sure to find the best options for you.
​
### Features

Our application finds recipes for you using different tools to help get the perfect combination.

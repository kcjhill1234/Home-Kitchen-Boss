### [Our Application](https://home-kitchen-boss.herokuapp.com/)
​ 
### User Story
Everybody has had those moment where they just want to find something for dinner but don't know what. There's been too many times where we've been hungry but don't know what to make so we just end up getting takeout and leaving all of those ingredients in your fridge to get old and rot. So we dedided to do something about it. We decided to make an application that makes it quick and easy to find a good recipe for you taking allergies into to make sure to find the best options for you.
​
### Features
We have several features on our application that we are happy to share with you.
Our application finds recipes for you using different tools to help get the perfect combination. This application even has a dropdown for allergies making it a lot easier for when you need to leave some ingredients out instead of having to research the same recipe several times just to find one that will be okay for you to eat with your allergies.
